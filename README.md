This repository contains laboratory work performed as part of a course dedicated to the study of graph theory. In the process of completing the tasks, various approaches and algorithms typical for working with graphs were used.

Due to the fact that some laboratory work was performed at different stages of mastering the material, it can be noted that parts of the program code are written in hybrid C and C++ languages. This is due to the process of learning and experimenting with various programming methods and tools.

Each lab work includes a description of the task, as well as an implementation of the solution with use cases.
